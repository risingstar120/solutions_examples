# Hard reset all the BGP connections using CLI command "clear bgp vrf all all *".

trigger_datafile:
    # Mandatory:
  timeout:
      max_time: 180
                      in second. Default: 180
      interval (`int`): Wait time between iterations when looping is needed,
                      in second. Default: 15
#    Optional:
        # tgn_timeout (`int`): Maximum wait time for all traffic threads to be
        #                      restored to the reference rate,
        #                      in second. Default: 60
        # tgn_delay (`int`): Wait time between each poll to verify if traffic is resumed,
        #                    in second. Default: 10

# steps:
#     1. Learn BGP Ops object and store the BGP instance(s)
#        if has any, otherwise, SKIP the trigger
#     2. Hard reset all the BGP connections with command "clear bgp vrf all all *"
#     3. Learn BGP Ops again, verify the uptime of BGP "established" neighbor(s) is reset,
#        and verify it is the same as the Ops in step 1 except the uptime
